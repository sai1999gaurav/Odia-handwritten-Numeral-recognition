# Odia-handwritten-Numeral-recognition
This article intend to show, how easily we can build a model for any indic character recognition

## Package used:
    OpenCV
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    ScikitLearn
## Data Set:
     Manually created in ms paint
     Size : 120 images of total 4 different numerals (417x293 pixels each): 
            30 sets of ‘୦’  in English it is 0
            30 sets of ‘୧’  in English it is 1
            30 sets of ‘୨’  in English it is 2
            30 sets of ‘୩’  in English it is 3
